'stdtools' is a custom C library containing a number of useful c functions.

## What is 'stdtools'? ##

**stdtools** is a custom **C** library. Many of us C programmers find functions we need to use in many programs. It's a boring work copying and writing the same functions over and over again. So, to solve this, I've made a custom library that every c programmers can use. It contains a number of common and useful C functions. The 'Func_list.txt' file contains the list of functions present in the library.

**stdtools** is made open-source for the help of other programmers. Feel free to use it, and of course contributing in it. If you can upgrade any function, modify it to run in efficient ways, please go ahead. The more function it contains, the better for others.
